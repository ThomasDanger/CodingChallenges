 `Challenges Involving Bitwise Operations`
 
 This is a small collection of solutions to challenges that involve bitwise operations. 
 
 This was inspired by my previous--still-ongoing-- project, Tic-Tac-Toe in Assembly. In that project, I used bitwise operations to play an entire game of tic-tac-toe on a single integer. I found this idea so fun that I decided to look into other applications of bitwise operations. 
 
 What I found was rather disappointing as bitwise operations appear far less useful in higher level languages than in assembly, but these challenges I found were still fun to do.
